        Wrapper Class = Provides a way to use primitive data types as reference data types
                        Reference data types contain useful methods
                        Can be used with collections (ex.ArrayList)
                        It takes much time and power to process a reference data type.

        Autoboxing: The automatic conversion that the Java compiler makes between the primitive types and their corresponding object wrapper class.
        Unboxing:   The reverse of autoboxing. Automatic conversion of wrapper class to primitive.
